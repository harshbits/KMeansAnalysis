# KMeansAnalysis
This project contains the similarity between twitter's tweets using KMeans method and Jaccard Distance calculation and Random Points analysis using Euclidean Distance matrix.

*Jaccard Distance*

To run the code for the jaccard distance you should run the following commands in the command prompt.

> javac *.java
> java KMeansAnalysis <value of k> InitialSeeds.txt <or any other path> Tweets.json <Appropriate path for json>output.txt <any path for output file or format>

=============================================================================

To run the code for the Euclidian Distance you should run the following commands in the command prompt.

> javac *.java
> java KMeansAnalysis <value of k> test_data.txt<or any other path> output.txt <any path for output file or format>

* As I have run this code so many times using different value of k, I have included top 5 from it.
* They are mentioned below one by one.

================================================================================

NOTE: 
I haven't used any kind of *external library* to run this code.
